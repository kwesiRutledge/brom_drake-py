# Suggested Use of the ShowMeThisModel Production

Sometimes, you just want to see what a given model looks like in Drake. For the cases when you know that your model is
"Drake-ready", then you can simply give it to this Production and it will quickly display it for you. If you have an ideal joint configuration for the robot, then you can provide that to the scene and it will place the robot in your desired configuration.
