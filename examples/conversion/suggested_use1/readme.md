# Suggested Use #1

This example illustrates the suggested use of the "Drake-ify"
feature of brom.

It is recommended that you use the `drakeify_my_urdf()`
convenience function to do the conversion. In one line,
it will convert your urdf file into a form that drake
can consume, and then returns to you the path of the converted
file. Then, you can use the path as if it were your original
file.

Look into the example for more details.
