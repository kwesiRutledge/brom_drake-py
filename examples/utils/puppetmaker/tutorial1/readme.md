# Tutorial 1

An implementation of the tutorial "rotating cube" using the 
new utility, the `Puppetmaker`.

## Description

Instead of using the rather physically unrealistic `BlockHandlerSystem`, this tutorial uses the `Puppetmaker` object to move the block around. This makes for much more realistic motion and is a bit more interpretable than my previous approach to teaching others about Drake.
