# Advanced Usage: Changing The Visual Appearance of Some Of the Puppet Links

A modification of the "rotating cube" tutorial using the 
new utility, the `Puppetmaker`.

## Description

Unlike the original `tutorial1` or the `tutorial1` example in the puppetmaker examples, this method uses the `PuppetmakerConfiguration` to change the visual appearance of the links that are used in puppeteering. 

We will make the links a different, unique color (red) and change their size to something smaller than the input queue.
